mdm loh
she is our hero
she teaches us science and helps us in bad times
she is kind and tells us stories
so her classes are always so interesting
im very grateful for the hardwork she has put
giving us inspirational quotes to support us whenever
and when we fail, she is not mad
instead she is glad to help us improve
mdm loh
always with a smile 
and making sure we eat well ( donuts )
she is the _kindest_ person i have ever met
thank you for all the jokes and helping me through struggles
you are the **best** teacher ever !
